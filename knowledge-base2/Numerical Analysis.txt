Numerical Analysis is the study of algorithms for solving mathematical problems that arise in science and engineering. Many mathematical problems, especially those involving continuous variables or complex equations, do not have analytical solutions that can be expressed in terms of simple formulas. Numerical analysis provides methods to approximate these solutions using numerical techniques that can be implemented on computers.

The field encompasses a wide range of topics, including finding roots of equations, solving systems of linear equations, interpolation and approximation of functions, numerical differentiation and integration, and solving ordinary and partial differential equations. For example, finding the roots of a complex polynomial or solving a system of hundreds or thousands of linear equations is often infeasible to do by hand but can be efficiently solved using numerical algorithms. Similarly, calculating the definite integral of a function that does not have a simple antiderivative can be done using numerical integration techniques like the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.

A key consideration in numerical analysis is the accuracy and stability of the algorithms. Numerical methods introduce errors, such as rounding errors from finite-precision arithmetic or truncation errors from approximating continuous functions with discrete values. Numerical analysts study these errors and design algorithms that minimize their impact and are stable, meaning that small changes in the input do not lead to large changes in the output. The development of efficient and accurate numerical algorithms is essential for computational science and engineering, enabling simulations, data analysis, and solving complex problems in fields ranging from weather forecasting and financial modeling to structural analysis and fluid dynamics.
