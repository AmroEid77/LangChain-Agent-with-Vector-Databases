Semiconductor Physics is a branch of physics that studies the electrical properties of semiconductor materials. Semiconductors are materials that have electrical conductivity between that of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like glass). Their unique properties, particularly their ability to change conductivity under different conditions, make them the foundation of modern electronics. Silicon and germanium are two of the most well-known semiconductors.

The electrical properties of semiconductors are determined by their band structure, which describes the allowed energy levels for electrons within the material. In semiconductors, there is a band gap between the valence band (where electrons are normally located) and the conduction band (where electrons can move freely and conduct current). At low temperatures, the valence band is full and the conduction band is empty, making the semiconductor behave like an insulator. However, with increasing temperature or the introduction of impurities (doping), electrons can gain enough energy to jump into the conduction band, increasing the conductivity.

Doping is a crucial technique in semiconductor physics, involving intentionally adding small amounts of impurities to a semiconductor material to alter its electrical properties. N-type semiconductors are created by doping with donor impurities, which contribute free electrons to the conduction band. P-type semiconductors are created by doping with acceptor impurities, which create "holes" (the absence of an electron) in the valence band that can also carry current. The interface between p-type and n-type semiconductors forms a p-n junction, which is the fundamental building block of many electronic devices, including diodes and transistors. Understanding semiconductor physics is essential for designing and fabricating the microelectronic devices that power computers, smartphones, and countless other technologies.
