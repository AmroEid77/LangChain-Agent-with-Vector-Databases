Molecular biology is a branch of biology that concerns the molecular basis of biological activity between biomolecules in the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between the different types of DNA, RNA, and proteins and their biosynthesis as well as the regulation of these interactions. It delves into the intricate machinery of life at the molecular level, seeking to understand how genetic information is stored, replicated, transcribed, and translated into functional proteins that carry out the vast array of cellular processes.

A central dogma of molecular biology outlines the flow of genetic information: from DNA to RNA through transcription, and from RNA to protein through translation. DNA, the genetic blueprint, is replicated to pass information to new cells. Specific segments of DNA, called genes, are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. These mRNA molecules then serve as templates for the synthesis of proteins, the workhorses of the cell, which perform diverse functions ranging from catalyzing metabolic reactions to providing structural support and transmitting signals. The regulation of gene expression, controlling when and where genes are turned on or off, is a critical aspect of molecular biology, allowing cells to respond to their environment and differentiate into specialized types.

Techniques in molecular biology are constantly evolving, enabling scientists to manipulate and analyze DNA, RNA, and proteins with increasing precision. Recombinant DNA technology allows for the cutting and pasting of DNA segments, leading to genetic engineering. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) enables the amplification of tiny amounts of DNA. Gel electrophoresis is used to separate DNA, RNA, or proteins based on size. DNA sequencing technologies allow for the determination of the exact order of nucleotides in a DNA molecule. These tools have revolutionized fields like medicine, agriculture, and forensics, leading to the development of gene therapies, genetically modified crops, and DNA fingerprinting. Molecular biology continues to unravel the complexities of life, providing insights into health, disease, and evolution.
