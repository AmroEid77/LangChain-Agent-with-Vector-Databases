# Semiconductor Physics

Semiconductor physics explores materials with electrical conductivity between conductors and insulators, forming the foundation of modern electronics. Unlike metals with continuous conduction bands, semiconductors possess an energy gap between valence and conduction bands, enabling precise control of electrical properties through doping, temperature variation, and external fields. This unique behavior has revolutionized technology, enabling devices from transistors to solar cells that power our digital world.

The band structure of semiconductors explains their distinctive properties. Valence bands contain bound electrons that form covalent bonds between atoms, while conduction bands hold mobile electrons that contribute to electrical current. The energy gap between these bands—ranging from 0.1 to 4 electron volts—determines many material properties. Silicon, with its 1.12 eV bandgap at room temperature, offers an ideal compromise between conductivity and insulation for most electronic applications, explaining its dominance in the semiconductor industry.

Intrinsic semiconductors contain equal numbers of electrons and holes (electron vacancies), with carrier concentration determined by temperature and bandgap width. At absolute zero, pure semiconductors behave as insulators, but thermal energy promotes electrons across the bandgap as temperature increases, creating electron-hole pairs that enhance conductivity. This negative temperature coefficient of resistance distinguishes semiconductors from metals, which exhibit increasing resistance at higher temperatures due to enhanced phonon scattering.

Doping—intentionally introducing impurities—dramatically alters semiconductor properties. N-type doping with group V elements (phosphorus, arsenic) introduces extra electrons, creating majority carriers that enhance conductivity. P-type doping with group III elements (boron, gallium) creates holes as majority carriers. Controlled doping enables formation of p-n junctions—interfaces between differently doped regions that form the building blocks of electronic devices. These junctions create built-in electric fields that separate charge carriers, forming depletion regions crucial for diode and transistor operation.

Carrier transport mechanisms determine semiconductor device performance. Drift current results from carrier movement under electric fields, with mobility defining how readily carriers respond to these fields. Diffusion current arises from carrier concentration gradients, with carriers moving from high to low concentration regions. The Einstein relation connects mobility and diffusion coefficient, linking these fundamental transport processes. These mechanisms, combined with generation and recombination processes that create and annihilate electron-hole pairs, govern semiconductor device behavior.

Modern semiconductor devices leverage quantum effects at nanoscale dimensions. Quantum confinement in structures like quantum wells, wires, and dots creates discrete energy levels rather than continuous bands, enabling tunable optical and electrical properties. Tunnel junctions exploit quantum mechanical tunneling of electrons through thin barriers, enabling unique current-voltage characteristics. These quantum phenomena, once considered exotic physics, now underpin technologies from high-brightness LEDs to quantum cascade lasers and form the basis for emerging quantum computing architectures.
