Analytical Chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the identification and quantification of chemical substances. It involves separating, identifying, and determining the relative amounts of components in a sample. Analytical chemists develop and apply methods to answer questions about the composition of matter, such as "What is in this sample?" and "How much of it is there?". This field is crucial in a wide range of applications, including quality control, environmental monitoring, forensic science, medical diagnostics, and research in other scientific disciplines.

Analytical methods can be broadly classified into classical and instrumental techniques. Classical methods, such as gravimetric analysis (measuring mass) and volumetric analysis (measuring volume), rely on chemical reactions and precise measurements using standard laboratory equipment. Instrumental methods, which are more common in modern analytical chemistry, utilize sophisticated instruments to measure physical or chemical properties of the sample. Examples include spectroscopy (measuring the interaction of light with matter), chromatography (separating components of a mixture), and electrochemistry (measuring electrical properties).

The process of chemical analysis typically involves several steps: sampling (obtaining a representative portion of the material), sample preparation (treating the sample to make it suitable for analysis), performing the measurement using an appropriate technique, and interpreting the results, often using statistical methods to assess accuracy and precision. Analytical chemists must carefully consider sources of error and validate their methods to ensure reliable results. The development of new and more sensitive analytical techniques is an ongoing area of research, driven by the need to detect substances at ever lower concentrations and analyze increasingly complex samples. Analytical chemistry provides the essential tools for understanding the composition of the world around us.
