Organic Chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and synthesis of organic compounds, which are chemical compounds containing carbon. While carbon is the defining element, organic compounds often also contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and halogens. The unique ability of carbon atoms to form stable bonds with each other in chains and rings, as well as with atoms of other elements, gives rise to an enormous diversity of organic molecules, forming the basis of life and countless synthetic materials.

The structure of organic molecules is crucial to understanding their properties and reactivity. Organic chemists use various representations, such as Lewis structures, condensed formulas, and skeletal structures, to depict the arrangement of atoms and bonds. Functional groups, specific groups of atoms within a molecule (like hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, or amino groups), are particularly important as they are the sites of most chemical reactions and largely determine a molecule's chemical behavior. Understanding the mechanisms of organic reactions, the step-by-step process by which reactants are transformed into products, is a central theme in organic chemistry. This involves studying how electrons move and bonds are broken and formed during a reaction.

Organic synthesis, the construction of complex organic molecules from simpler ones, is a significant part of the field. Chemists develop strategies and reactions to create new compounds with desired properties, which is essential for the development of pharmaceuticals, polymers, dyes, and many other valuable materials. Techniques like spectroscopy (NMR, IR, Mass Spectrometry) are indispensable tools for identifying and characterizing organic compounds. Organic chemistry is fundamental to many other scientific disciplines, including biochemistry, medicine, materials science, and environmental science. Its principles are applied in drug discovery and development, the creation of new plastics and fibers, and the understanding of biological processes.
