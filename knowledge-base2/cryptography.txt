# Cryptography

Cryptography, the science of secure communication, transforms readable information into unintelligible formats and back again through mathematical algorithms and protocols. This discipline serves four fundamental objectives: confidentiality (preventing unauthorized access), integrity (detecting alterations), authentication (verifying identities), and non-repudiation (preventing denial of actions). From ancient ciphers to quantum-resistant algorithms, cryptography has evolved alongside technological advances, maintaining its essential role in protecting sensitive information.

Symmetric encryption uses identical keys for encryption and decryption, offering computational efficiency for large data volumes. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), selected through an international competition, employs substitution-permutation networks with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits to resist cryptanalytic attacks. Block ciphers like AES process fixed-length data blocks, while stream ciphers such as ChaCha20 generate pseudorandom keystreams combined with plaintext. Despite their efficiency, symmetric algorithms face key distribution challenges, as secure key exchange must precede communication.

Public key cryptography revolutionized secure communication by introducing asymmetric key pairs—one public and one private—enabling secure interactions without prior shared secrets. RSA, developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, leverages the computational difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, using the public key for encryption and the private key for decryption. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) achieves comparable security with shorter keys by exploiting algebraic structures of elliptic curves over finite fields, providing efficiency advantages for resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and IoT applications.

Cryptographic hash functions generate fixed-length digests from arbitrary data inputs, with slight input changes producing drastically different outputs. These one-way functions, exemplified by SHA-256 and SHA-3, resist preimage attacks (finding inputs producing specific outputs) and collision attacks (finding different inputs yielding identical outputs). Hash functions validate data integrity in digital signatures, password storage, and blockchain technologies, where hash chains establish tamper-evident transaction records.

Authenticated encryption combines confidentiality with integrity protection, addressing vulnerabilities in separate implementation of these security properties. Modes like AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) and ChaCha20-Poly1305 provide authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), generating authentication tags that verify both message content and contextual information. These modes detect both message tampering and replay attacks, offering comprehensive protection for secure communications protocols.

Post-quantum cryptography addresses theoretical threats posed by quantum computing advances, particularly Shor's algorithm, which could break widely-used public key systems by efficiently factoring large numbers and solving discrete logarithm problems. Lattice-based cryptography, hash-based signatures, multivariate cryptography, and code-based systems represent promising approaches resistant to quantum attacks. As standardization efforts proceed through NIST's evaluation process, organizations increasingly implement crypto-agility—the ability to rapidly transition between cryptographic algorithms—as a risk management strategy for the approaching post-quantum era.
