Artificial Intelligence (AI) in computer science is the field dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. The goal of AI is to develop intelligent agents, which are systems that can perceive their environment and take actions to maximize their chances of achieving a goal.

AI encompasses a wide range of approaches and subfields. Machine learning, a prominent subfield, focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This includes supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error). Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data like images, audio, and text.

Other areas within AI include natural language processing (enabling computers to understand and generate human language), computer vision (enabling computers to "see" and interpret images), robotics (designing and programming robots to perform tasks), and expert systems (systems that mimic the decision-making ability of a human expert). AI has numerous applications across various industries, including healthcare (medical diagnosis, drug discovery), finance (fraud detection, algorithmic trading), transportation (autonomous vehicles), and entertainment (recommendation systems). While AI offers significant potential to improve lives and solve complex problems, it also raises important ethical considerations regarding bias, privacy, and the future of work.
