Electromagnetism is a fundamental force of nature that describes the interaction between electrically charged particles. It is governed by a set of four elegant equations known as Maxwell's equations, which unify electricity and magnetism and explain a wide range of phenomena, from the behavior of light to the operation of electrical circuits and wireless communication.

Electromagnetism encompasses several key concepts. Electric charges, either positive or negative, are the source of electric fields, which exert forces on other charges. Moving electric charges, or electric currents, create magnetic fields, which exert forces on other moving charges and magnetic materials. A changing magnetic field, in turn, can induce an electric current, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction, which is the principle behind electric generators and transformers.

Electromagnetic waves, such as visible light, radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays, are disturbances in the electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space at the speed of light. Maxwell's equations predicted the existence of these waves and showed that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon. The study of electromagnetism is essential for understanding the behavior of light, the operation of electrical and electronic devices, and the principles behind technologies like telecommunications, medical imaging, and particle accelerators. It is a cornerstone of modern physics and engineering, providing the theoretical basis for much of our technological world.
