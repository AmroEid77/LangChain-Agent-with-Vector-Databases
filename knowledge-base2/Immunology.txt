Immunology is the branch of biology that studies the immune system, a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) and other foreign substances. The immune system is essential for maintaining health and preventing disease.

The immune system is broadly divided into two main branches: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system provides a rapid, non-specific defense against pathogens and includes physical barriers (like skin and mucous membranes), chemical defenses (like enzymes in tears and saliva), and cells that engulf and destroy pathogens (like phagocytes). The adaptive immune system is a more sophisticated and specific defense that develops over time in response to exposure to specific pathogens. It involves lymphocytes, particularly B cells and T cells, which can recognize and remember specific antigens (molecules on the surface of pathogens).

B cells produce antibodies, which are proteins that can bind to antigens and neutralize pathogens or mark them for destruction. T cells have various functions, including killing infected cells (cytotoxic T cells) and coordinating the immune response (helper T cells). A key feature of the adaptive immune system is immunological memory, which allows for a faster and stronger response upon subsequent exposure to the same pathogen. Immunology is crucial for understanding infectious diseases, developing vaccines and immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases, and preventing transplant rejection. Research in immunology continues to uncover the intricate mechanisms of the immune system and develop new strategies to harness its power for treating a wide range of conditions.
