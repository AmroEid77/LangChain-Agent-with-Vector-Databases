Pharmacology is the branch of medicine and biology concerned with the study of drug action, where a drug can be broadly defined as any artificial, natural, or endogenous molecule which exerts a biochemical or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism. In the context of pharmacy, pharmacology is a core discipline that provides the scientific basis for the rational and safe use of medications. It explores how drugs interact with biological systems to produce their therapeutic effects, as well as their potential side effects and toxicities.

Pharmacology is typically divided into two main branches: pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamics studies the effects of a drug on the body – what the drug does to the body. This involves understanding the mechanisms of drug action, including how drugs bind to receptors, activate or inhibit enzymes, or interfere with cellular processes. It also examines the dose-response relationship, which describes how the magnitude of a drug's effect changes with the dose. Pharmacokinetics, on the other hand, studies the effects of the body on a drug – what the body does to the drug. This involves the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), which determine how a drug moves through the body, how long it stays there, and how it is eliminated.

Pharmacists use their knowledge of pharmacology to understand how different drugs work, how they interact with each other and with food, and how individual patient factors (such as age, genetics, and disease states) can influence drug response. This knowledge is critical for dispensing medications accurately, counseling patients on proper drug use, monitoring for adverse effects, and collaborating with physicians to optimize drug therapy. As new drugs are developed, pharmacists must continuously update their understanding of their pharmacological properties to ensure patient safety and efficacy.
