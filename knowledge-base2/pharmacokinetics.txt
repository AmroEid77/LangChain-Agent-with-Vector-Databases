# Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics examines the temporal course of drug concentrations in the body, encompassing the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). This quantitative discipline provides the scientific framework for understanding how drugs move through biological systems, enabling rational dosage regimen design and optimization of therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.

Absorption describes drug movement from administration site to systemic circulation. For oral medications, factors influencing this process include gastrointestinal pH, drug solubility, surface area for absorption, and first-pass metabolism. The Biopharmaceutics Classification System categorizes drugs based on solubility and permeability characteristics, predicting absorption behavior. Bioavailability—the fraction of administered dose reaching circulation unchanged—varies significantly between administration routes, with intravenous delivery providing complete bioavailability while oral routes often demonstrate reduced values due to incomplete absorption and hepatic metabolism.

Distribution reflects drug movement from bloodstream to tissues and organs. This process depends on cardiac output, regional blood flow, tissue permeability, and plasma protein binding. Highly protein-bound drugs remain largely confined to circulation, while unbound fractions cross biological membranes to reach target tissues. Volume of distribution (Vd), a pharmacokinetic parameter relating total drug amount in the body to plasma concentration, assists in determining loading doses and predicting drug accumulation in tissues. Specialized barriers, including the blood-brain barrier and placental barrier, limit distribution to protected compartments through tight junctions and efflux transporters.

Metabolism transforms drugs into more hydrophilic metabolites facilitating elimination, primarily occurring in the liver through phase I (functionalization) and phase II (conjugation) reactions. Cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyze most phase I oxidative reactions, demonstrating genetic polymorphisms that account for interindividual variability in drug response. Phase II reactions conjugate drugs or phase I metabolites with endogenous substrates like glucuronic acid, sulfate, or glutathione. Metabolic processes can generate inactive compounds, active metabolites with therapeutic properties, or toxic intermediates responsible for adverse reactions.

Excretion eliminates drugs and their metabolites from the body, primarily through renal and biliary pathways. Glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion, and passive reabsorption govern renal drug elimination, with filtration rates declining in elderly patients and those with kidney disease, necessitating dosage adjustments. Hepatobiliary excretion facilitates elimination through feces, particularly important for drugs with high molecular weight. Clearance—the theoretical volume of blood completely cleared of drug per unit time—integrates all elimination processes, determining drug half-life and dosing intervals.

Pharmacokinetic models mathematically describe drug concentration-time profiles. Compartmental models represent the body as interconnected compartments with first-order transfer rates between them. Non-compartmental analysis provides parameter estimates without assuming specific structural models. Population pharmacokinetics identifies sources of variability among patients, accounting for factors like weight, age, and genetics. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models incorporate anatomical and physiological parameters to predict drug behavior across different populations, facilitating drug development and regulatory decision-making.
