Biochemistry

Biochemistry examines the molecular basis of life, investigating chemical processes and substances occurring within living organisms. This interdisciplinary field bridges chemistry and biology, revealing how biomolecules interact through intricate reaction networks to sustain living systems. From enzymes catalyzing metabolic reactions to nucleic acids storing genetic information, biochemistry illuminates fundamental mechanisms underlying physiological functions and pathological conditions.

Proteins serve diverse functions as cellular workhorses, from catalysis to structural support and signal transduction. These biomolecules consist of amino acid chains linked by peptide bonds, with each amino acid contributing unique chemical properties through its distinctive side chain. Primary structure—the linear amino acid sequence—determines subsequent folding into secondary structures like alpha helices and beta sheets, stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Tertiary structure represents overall three-dimensional conformation maintained through various interactions including disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic effects. Quaternary structure emerges when multiple polypeptides associate, forming functional complexes like hemoglobin, which cooperatively binds oxygen through allosteric mechanisms. Protein function intimately connects to structure, with slight conformational changes potentially altering activity.

Enzymes dramatically accelerate biochemical reactions without being consumed, enabling metabolic processes to proceed at biologically relevant rates. These specialized proteins lower activation energy by stabilizing transition states through highly specific active sites that bind substrates in optimal orientations. Enzyme kinetics follows Michaelis-Menten models, with initial velocity increasing hyperbolically with substrate concentration until saturation occurs. Regulatory mechanisms including allosteric modulation, covalent modification, and proteolytic activation control enzyme activity, allowing metabolic responsiveness to cellular conditions. Enzyme inhibitors—competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive—modulate activity by interfering with substrate binding or catalytic function, providing valuable pharmacological tools for treating diseases from hypertension to bacterial infections.

Carbohydrates perform diverse biological roles, from energy storage and structural support to cellular recognition. Monosaccharides like glucose serve as primary metabolic fuels, undergoing glycolysis to generate ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation before entering oxidative pathways. Disaccharides such as sucrose and lactose connect monosaccharides through glycosidic bonds, while polysaccharides like glycogen and starch store glucose in branched structures for energy reserves. Structural polysaccharides include cellulose, providing plant cell wall rigidity, and chitin, forming arthropod exoskeletons. Glycoconjugates attach carbohydrates to proteins or lipids, creating glycoproteins and glycolipids essential for cell-surface recognition events and immune function.

Lipids encompass hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules performing vital functions from energy storage to membrane formation. Fatty acids consist of hydrocarbon chains with terminal carboxyl groups, varying in length and saturation levels that influence melting points and membrane fluidity. Triacylglycerols store energy efficiently in adipose tissue through fatty acids esterified to glycerol. Phospholipids form biological membranes through amphipathic structures with hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, creating selectively permeable bilayers that compartmentalize cellular processes. Steroids share a distinctive four-ring structure, with cholesterol maintaining membrane integrity and serving as precursor for steroid hormones regulating diverse physiological processes from metabolism to sexual development.

Metabolic pathways integrate complex reaction sequences that extract energy from nutrients and synthesize essential biomolecules. Cellular respiration converts glucose to carbon dioxide through glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, generating ATP through substrate-level and chemiosmotic mechanisms. Fatty acid oxidation cleaves two-carbon acetyl-CoA units sequentially, feeding into the TCA cycle for energy production. Amino acid metabolism involves transamination and oxidative deamination processes, with carbon skeletons entering central metabolic pathways. Anabolic processes reconstruct complex molecules from simpler precursors, exemplified by gluconeogenesis synthesizing glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates and fatty acid synthesis building lipids from acetyl-CoA through reactions requiring reducing power from NADPH.
