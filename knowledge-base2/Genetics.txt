Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in living organisms. It is a cornerstone of modern biology, providing the framework for understanding how traits are passed from parents to offspring and how variations in genes can lead to differences between individuals and populations. The fundamental unit of heredity is the gene, a segment of DNA that contains the instructions for building a protein or a functional RNA molecule.

Classical genetics, initiated by Gregor Mendel's work with pea plants, established the basic principles of inheritance, including the concepts of dominant and recessive alleles, segregation, and independent assortment. This laid the groundwork for understanding how traits are transmitted across generations. Molecular genetics delves into the physical and chemical nature of genes, focusing on the structure and function of DNA, RNA, and proteins. This includes studying processes like DNA replication, transcription, and translation, as well as the mechanisms of gene regulation.

Population genetics examines the genetic variation within populations and how it changes over time due to factors like mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. This helps us understand evolutionary processes and the genetic basis of adaptation. Medical genetics focuses on the role of genes in human health and disease, including the study of genetic disorders, genetic testing, and gene therapy. Modern genetics utilizes powerful technologies like DNA sequencing, PCR, and gene editing (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9) to analyze and manipulate genetic material. Genetics has profound implications for medicine, agriculture, forensics, and our understanding of the history of life on Earth.
