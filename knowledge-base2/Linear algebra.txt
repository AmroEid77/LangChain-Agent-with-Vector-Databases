Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics concerning linear equations, linear functions, and their representations through matrices and vector spaces. It is a fundamental tool in many areas of mathematics, science, and engineering, providing the language and methods to solve systems of linear equations, analyze transformations, and understand the structure of vector spaces.

A central object in linear algebra is the matrix, a rectangular array of numbers. Matrices are used to represent linear transformations, which are functions that map vectors to vectors in a way that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. Matrix operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion, are essential for manipulating linear systems and transformations. Solving systems of linear equations, a common problem in many disciplines, can be efficiently handled using matrix methods, such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule.

Vector spaces are abstract mathematical structures that generalize the concept of vectors in two or three dimensions. A vector space is a set of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars, satisfying certain axioms. Concepts like linear independence, span, basis, and dimension are fundamental to understanding the structure of vector spaces. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are special vectors that are only scaled by a linear transformation, playing a crucial role in analyzing the behavior of linear systems, such as in stability analysis or data compression techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Linear algebra provides a powerful framework for modeling and solving problems that can be expressed in terms of linear relationships, making it indispensable in fields ranging from computer graphics and machine learning to economics and physics.
